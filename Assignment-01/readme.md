#Assignement 01

## Brief

Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to customize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

## Project description
PinBoard is a minimal and intuitive digital board for collecting and managing short notes or ideas, just like sticky notes.
Each pin can be given a color and size, edited inline, or deleted with a simple “×”.
The layout can be toggled between list and grid (card) view, adapting responsively to the screen size.

The app relies entirely on vanilla JavaScript, manipulating the DOM directly and maintaining an internal array of pin objects as the “single source of truth.”
